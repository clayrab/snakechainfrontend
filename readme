Hi,

I need to develop a mascot/character for my app. It's a worm, so presents some challenges.

I need it to be appealing to my early adopters(20-30 year old males) but it also needs to be universally appealing. I'm imagining something like a Pixar character.

Are you up for the challenge now? I can buy your standard package and give you some more details if that's acceptable.
